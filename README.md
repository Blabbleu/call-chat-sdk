# Call Chat SDK

This repository contains a React SDK providing chat and call components.

## Example Application

A small Vite application is provided under `example-app/` to demonstrate how to consume the SDK. It mounts `ChatCenter` and `CallCenter` routes using `react-router`.

To run the example (requires `npm` with internet access):

```bash
cd example-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server on <http://localhost:5173>.
